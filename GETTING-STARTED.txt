To finish configuring the project:

1) open CMakeLists.txt and complete each TODO

2) set up the debugging profile
    cd into build-debug
    Run `cmake ..` to generate build files
    Run `make` or `cmake --build` from build-debug to build the project

3) Create a symlink to compile_commands.json in project root
    Run the following command in build-debug
    `link compile_commands.json ../compile_commands.json`

4) set up the release profile
    cd into build-release
    run `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..` to generate build files
    Run `make` or `cmake --build` from build-release to build the project

5) remove .git folder and run `git init`

6) Code!
