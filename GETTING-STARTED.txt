To finish configuring the project:

1) open CMakeLists.txt and complete each TODO

2) set up the debugging profile
    mkdir build-debug
    cd into build-debug
    Run `cmake ..` to generate build files
    Run `make` or `cmake --build` from build-debug to build the project

3) set up the release profile
    mkdir build-release
    cd into build-release
    run `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..` to generate build files
    Run `make` or `cmake --build` from build-release to build the project
